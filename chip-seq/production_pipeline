This production pipeline is used to analyze the chipseq data around the open regions of chromatin and open regions of chromatin near synaptic genes.

#Create the Necessary directories
mkdir chipseq
mkdir chipseq/slurm

#Copy the necessary files to the directory
    motifs
    idr_intersect

#Download all the chipseq files 


#Bedtools Intersect the IDR against the chipseq data

#Add to a table with the overlap and the percentage of peaks in chipseq data that overlap.
